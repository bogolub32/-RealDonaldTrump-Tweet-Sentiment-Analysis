# -RealDonaldTrump-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
This was a short project I recently did on using a bayes classifier to score the sentiment of Donald Trump's tweets

to use, all you need to do is replace @RealDonaldTrump with what ever user handle you want to analyze. The user must be public, or you must follow eachother in order for this to work.
